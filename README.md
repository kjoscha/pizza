THis is a react native app. The simplest way is to use it via expo. Install it with `sudo npm install -g expo-cli`, install all dependencies with `npm install` and then start the expo server with `npm start`.

To use your restdb.io database, create a file named Secrets.js with a content like `export const RESTDB_IO_KEY = '123abc...';`.
